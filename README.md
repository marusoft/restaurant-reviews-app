## Restaurant Reviews App Overview
I incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. And I take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Responsive Design
* All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.
* Content make use of available screen real estate and display correctly at all screen sizes.
* Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the
  browser, regardless of viewport size.
* Restaurants and Images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours
  elements and reviews in all viewports.  

## Accessibility
* All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.
* Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page.
* Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.

## Offline Availability
 The site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.

## Dependencies
The following were the dependencies that was used during the implementation of the **Restaurant Reviews** projects :

### Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer using Python

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: 


```
python -V

If you have Python 2.x, 

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

```

(or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 

For Python 3.x,

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
